/**
 * Skill Active State Management
 *
 * Tracks when a skill is actively executing so the persistent-mode Stop hook
 * can prevent premature session termination.
 *
 * Skills like plan, external-context, deepinit etc. don't write mode state
 * files (ralph-state.json, etc.), so the Stop hook previously had no way to
 * know they were running.
 *
 * This module provides:
 * 1. A protection level registry for all skills (none/light/medium/heavy)
 * 2. Read/write/clear functions for skill-active-state.json
 * 3. A check function for the Stop hook to determine if blocking is needed
 *
 * Fix for: https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode/issues/1033
